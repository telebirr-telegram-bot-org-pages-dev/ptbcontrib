============
Introduction
============

This library provides extensions for the `python-telegram-bot <https://python-telegram-bot.org>`_ library written and maintained by the community of PTB users.

==========
Installing
==========

Because this library is subject to more frequent changes than PTB, it is *not* available via PyPi. You can still install it via pip:

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install git+https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/ptbcontrib.git@main

If you want to use an extension that has some special requirements, you can install them on the fly as e.g.

.. code:: shell

    $ pip install "ptbcontrib[extension1,extension2] @ git+https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/ptbcontrib.git@main"

Or you can install from source with:

.. code:: shell

    $ git clone https://github.com/python-telegram-bot/ptbcontrib
    $ cd ptbcontrib
    $ python setup.py install
